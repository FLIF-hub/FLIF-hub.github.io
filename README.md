To run the app locally:

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Navigate to the folder in terminal or command prompt
3. run `node server.js` (or if you're on Windows just double-click `server.bat`)
4. In a browser go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If you need to update the styles and are unfamiliar with Sass, watch this introduction video:
