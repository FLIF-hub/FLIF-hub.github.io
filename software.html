    <h1 id="flif-software"><a href="/index.html">FLIF</a> Software</h1>

    <p>FLIF is still very young. As the format matures we expect support for it to grow in many areas.
       On this page, we give an overview of available FLIF plugins, applications, tools,
       and libraries.</p>

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Many items listed below do not have FLIF support yet, we would love for them to though. If you have
       an interest in working on one of these, <a href="http://gitter.im/FLIF-Hub/FLIF">let us know</a>!</p>


    <h2 id="reference">Reference implementation</h2>

    <p>The reference implementation of FLIF consists of a command line tool called <code>flif</code> and a shared library called <code>libflif</code>.
    They are licensed under the LGPLv3+.
    There is also a decoder-only library called <code>libflif_dec</code>, which is licensed under the more permissive Apache 2.0 license.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/FLIF-hub/FLIF">FLIF reference implementation</a></strong> - encoder, decoder (command-line tool)</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 id="browsers">Browsers</h2>

    <p>Currently there are no browsers that have native FLIF support. We hope for this to change at some point,
        but browser developers are understandably hesitant to support new image formats.
        There is however a javascript based implementation:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="https://uprootlabs.github.io/poly-flif">Poly-FLIF</a></strong> - A Polyfill for browsers that don't
            natively support FLIF.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you want to encourage browser developers to add FLIF support, maybe these pointers might help:</p>
